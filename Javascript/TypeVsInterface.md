 In TypeScript, both `type` and `interface` are used to define the shape of objects, but they have some differences in usage, capabilities, and flexibility. Here's a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Syntax**
- **Type**: Uses the `type` keyword.
- **Interface**: Uses the `interface` keyword.

```typescript
// Type
type UserType = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

// Interface
interface UserInterface {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

---

### **2. Extensibility**
- **Type**: Cannot be extended directly but can use intersections (`&`) to combine types.
- **Interface**: Can be extended using the `extends` keyword.

```typescript
// Extending a Type
type AdminType = UserType & { isAdmin: boolean };

// Extending an Interface
interface AdminInterface extends UserInterface {
  isAdmin: boolean;
}
```

---

### **3. Merging**
- **Type**: Cannot be merged. Re-declaring a `type` with the same name results in an error.
- **Interface**: Supports declaration merging, allowing you to add properties to the same interface in multiple declarations.

```typescript
// Type (Error on re-declaration)
type User = {
  id: number;
};

// type User = { // Error
//   name: string;
// };

// Interface (Declaration Merging)
interface User {
  id: number;
}

interface User {
  name: string;
}

// Merged Interface
const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
};
```

---

### **4. Usage**
- **Type**: Can define primitive types, union types, tuple types, and function types.
- **Interface**: Primarily used for defining object shapes but cannot define union or tuple types.

```typescript
// Type with Union and Tuple
type Status = "success" | "error";
type Point = [number, number];

// Interface (Not possible for unions or tuples)
// interface Status = "success" | "error"; // Error
// interface Point = [number, number];    // Error
```

---

### **5. Functions**
- Both can define function types, but the syntax differs slightly.
```typescript
// Type
type Add = (a: number, b: number) => number;

// Interface
interface Add {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}
```

---

### **6. React Props**
- Both `type` and `interface` are commonly used for defining React props. `type` is often preferred for its flexibility with unions.

```typescript
// Type for React Props
type ButtonProps = {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
};

// Interface for React Props
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
}
```

---

### **7. Performance**
- At runtime, both `type` and `interface` are erased and have no impact on performance. They are purely for compile-time type checking.

---

### **When to Use `type`**
1. When you need to define:
   - Union types
   - Tuple types
   - Primitive aliases
2. When you need more flexibility in combining types using intersections.

---

### **When to Use `interface`**
1. When you need to:
   - Extend or merge object shapes.
   - Work with classes, as interfaces are better suited for defining class contracts.
2. When you anticipate needing declaration merging.

### **Conclusion**
Use `type` for flexibility and defining complex types like unions and tuples. Use `interface` when you need to extend or merge object definitions, especially in scenarios involving class contracts. Both are powerful tools, and the choice often comes down to the specific use case and personal/team preferences.
