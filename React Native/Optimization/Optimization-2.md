Let's clarify the distinction between **`useCallback`** and **`useMemo`** a bit further to avoid confusion:

---

### **Key Differences and Their Implications**

1. **`useCallback`: Memoizes Function References**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures a **stable function reference** is passed to child components or used in event handlers.
   - **Does Not Prevent Function Execution**: Even though the reference is stable, the function's body will still execute whenever it is called.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for optimizing components wrapped in `React.memo` or preventing unnecessary re-renders when passing functions as props.

2. **`useMemo`: Memoizes Computed Values**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures the **result of a computation** is reused if dependencies haven't changed.
   - **Prevents Re-Execution of the Logic**: The computation is skipped if dependencies are the same, saving time and resources.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for optimizing expensive calculations or derived values.

---

### **Is `useMemo` More Efficient?**

It's not that `useMemo` is inherently "more efficient," but it serves a broader purpose:
- **`useCallback` only optimizes the function reference**. It doesnâ€™t stop the function from running; it just keeps the reference stable.
- **`useMemo` optimizes both the computation and the value**. It prevents both unnecessary execution and re-creation of the result.

### **When to Use Which**

- **Use `useCallback`**:
  - When you need to **stabilize a function reference**, typically for performance in child components.
  - Example: Passing an `onPress` or `onChange` callback to a child component that doesn't need to re-render.

- **Use `useMemo`**:
  - When you need to **memoize a computed value**, especially for expensive calculations.
  - Example: Filtering or transforming large datasets or memoizing derived state.

### **Illustrating Your Observation**

#### Without `useMemo`:
```javascript
const result = expensiveFunction(); // Re-executes every render
```

#### With `useMemo`:
```javascript
const result = useMemo(() => expensiveFunction(), [dependencies]); // Prevents re-execution
```

---

#### Without `useCallback`:
```javascript
const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Clicked'); // New reference on every render
};
```

#### With `useCallback`:
```javascript
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Clicked'); // Stable reference unless dependencies change
}, []);
```

---

### **Conclusion**

- `useCallback` prevents **function re-creation**, but not **execution**.
- `useMemo` prevents both **value re-creation** and **execution of expensive logic**.
- Use the one that fits your need: **function stabilization (`useCallback`)** or **value memoization (`useMemo`)**. 

So while `useMemo` might seem "more efficient," the **right hook** depends on what you're optimizing for! ðŸ˜Š
