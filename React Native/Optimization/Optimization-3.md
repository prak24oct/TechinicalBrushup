The connection between **`useCallback`** and **`React.memo`** lies in optimizing how child components are rendered. Let me break it down into **two scenarios**: using `React.memo` and not using it, to explain why `useCallback` is useful in preventing unnecessary re-renders.

---

### **1. When Using `React.memo`**

#### **How `React.memo` Works**
- `React.memo` is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) that **memoizes the rendered output** of a functional component.
- It prevents the component from re-rendering unless its **props** change.
- However, functions passed as props **always get a new reference on each render** unless you use `useCallback`.

#### **Problem Without `useCallback`:**
When you pass a new function reference to a memoized component, even if the function’s logic hasn't changed, `React.memo` **detects a prop change** because the reference is different. This causes the child component to re-render unnecessarily.

#### **Solution With `useCallback`:**
By using `useCallback`, you ensure that the function retains the **same reference** across renders as long as its dependencies don’t change. This allows `React.memo` to work as intended and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

---

#### **Example:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { Text, Button, View } from 'react-native';

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ onClick }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <Button title="Click Me" onPress={onClick} />;
});

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Without useCallback, this function gets a new reference on every render
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked');
  }, []); // Memoized function reference

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment Count" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;
```

#### **Behavior Without `useCallback`:**
- The `handleClick` function gets a **new reference** on every render.
- `React.memo` detects a change in props (`onClick` reference) and **re-renders `ChildComponent`**, even though its behavior hasn't changed.

#### **Behavior With `useCallback`:**
- The `handleClick` function is **memoized**, keeping the same reference unless dependencies change.
- `React.memo` recognizes the stable prop reference and skips re-rendering `ChildComponent`.

### **2. When Not Using `React.memo`**

Without `React.memo`, a child component **always re-renders** when its parent re-renders. However, `useCallback` is still useful for:

#### **1. Performance Optimization in Large Components**
If you have a large React Native component and you’re passing a function as a prop to a deeply nested child component, `useCallback` can help avoid unnecessary function re-creations. This reduces computation overhead, even if it doesn’t directly prevent re-renders.

#### **2. Preventing Event Listener Re-Creation**
If you pass functions as props to `TouchableOpacity`, `TextInput`, or similar components, re-creating these functions on every render can lead to performance inefficiencies.

#### **Example Without `React.memo`:**
```javascript
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Without useCallback, the function is re-created on every render
  const handlePress = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button pressed');
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment Count" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={handlePress}>
        <Text>Press Me</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
};
```

Here, **`useCallback` improves performance** by stabilizing the `handlePress` function reference, even though no memoization is applied to child components.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

#### **With `React.memo`:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders of memoized child components by stabilizing the function references passed as props.

#### **Without `React.memo`:**
- Reduces performance overhead by avoiding repeated re-creation of functions passed to components or event listeners.

---

### **General Rule of Thumb**
- Use `useCallback` **whenever you pass a function as a prop** to a component, especially if that component is memoized with `React.memo`.
- It’s still useful without `React.memo` for optimizing function re-creation in event handlers or deeply nested components.
