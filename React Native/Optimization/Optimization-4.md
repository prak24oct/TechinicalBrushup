Wrapping a child component in **`React.memo`** is often considered a **best practice** in React development, especially when optimizing performance. However, it’s not always necessary. Let’s dive deeper into when and why you should use it, and whether it qualifies as a standard practice.

### **Why Use `React.memo` for Child Components?**

- **Prevents Unnecessary Re-Renders:** By default, a child component re-renders whenever its parent re-renders, even if the child’s props haven’t changed. `React.memo` ensures the child only re-renders when its props or state actually change.
  
- **Optimizes Performance in Large Apps:** For complex components with expensive computations (e.g., rendering lists, large UIs, or handling animations), avoiding unnecessary renders can significantly improve performance.

### **When to Use `React.memo`**

#### **Good Scenarios for Using `React.memo`:**
1. **Pure Functional Components:**
   - If your child component behaves like a pure function (output depends only on props), `React.memo` works well to skip unnecessary renders.

2. **Expensive Child Components:**
   - If the child component performs heavy computations, API calls, or involves costly rendering processes, `React.memo` can be crucial.

3. **Components Receiving Stable Props:**
   - When the parent passes memoized props (using `useMemo`, `useCallback`, etc.), `React.memo` ensures the child doesn’t re-render unless those props change.

#### **When `React.memo` Is Unnecessary:**
1. **Small or Lightweight Components:**
   - If a child component is trivial or cheap to render, adding `React.memo` may add unnecessary complexity.

2. **Components with Frequent Prop Changes:**
   - If the props frequently change (e.g., a real-time updating counter), the cost of the memoization check can outweigh the performance benefits.

3. **Stateful Child Components:**
   - If the child component maintains internal state unrelated to its parent’s props, `React.memo` has limited benefit.

### **Is Wrapping All Child Components in `React.memo` a Standard Practice?**

No, it’s not a **universal standard practice**, but it is a **common optimization technique**. Whether or not to wrap child components in `React.memo` depends on:

1. **Application Complexity:**
   - In small apps or prototypes, avoiding `React.memo` might keep the code simpler without noticeable performance issues.
   - In large-scale applications, it becomes more important for optimizing performance.

2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
   - `React.memo` introduces a shallow comparison for props. If your child has complex prop structures (e.g., deeply nested objects or arrays), this can add overhead unless the props are memoized using `useMemo`.

3. **Project Standards:**
   - Some teams or projects adopt `React.memo` as a **default pattern** for all functional child components, while others selectively apply it where needed.

### **Example to Illustrate the Decision**

#### Without `React.memo`:
```javascript
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={handleClick} />
      <ChildComponent name="Prakhar" />
    </View>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = ({ name }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <Text>Hello, {name}</Text>;
};
```

- Every time the **Parent** re-renders, **ChildComponent** also re-renders, even though its `name` prop hasn’t changed.

#### With `React.memo`:
```javascript
const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <Text>Hello, {name}</Text>;
});
```

- Now, **ChildComponent** re-renders only when the `name` prop changes.

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Use `React.memo` for Child Components if:**
   - They are frequently reused or receive stable props.
   - They perform expensive rendering tasks.

2. **Combine `React.memo` with `useCallback`/`useMemo`:**
   - Ensure props (especially functions) passed to the child are memoized to take full advantage of `React.memo`.

3. **Avoid Overuse:**
   - Don’t wrap every child component in `React.memo` by default. Focus on components where performance improvements are noticeable.

4. **Measure Performance:**
   - Use tools like React Developer Tools Profiler to identify bottlenecks and confirm if `React.memo` has a positive impact.

### **Conclusion**

While wrapping child components in `React.memo` can prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance, it’s not always necessary. It’s better viewed as a **targeted optimization technique** rather than a universal standard practice. Use it where it makes sense based on your app’s complexity and performance needs.
