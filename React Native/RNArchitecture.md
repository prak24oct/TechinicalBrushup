React Native has gone through significant changes in its architecture over the years. The evolution of React Nativeâ€™s architecture is largely driven by the need for better performance, improved developer experience, and enhanced support for modern mobile applications. Below is an overview of the old architecture and the new architecture, highlighting the key differences between them.

### Old React Native Architecture

The older architecture (prior to 2021) was based on a **Bridge** between the JavaScript thread and the Native threads. Here's how it worked:

#### Key Components of the Old Architecture:
1. **JavaScript Thread**: This is where the core logic of the app runs. It handles UI rendering, business logic, and communication with the native code.
2. **Native Thread**: This is the thread where the native components (views, etc.) run. Native modules like camera, GPS, sensors, etc., interact with this thread.
3. **Bridge**: This was the central piece of the old architecture. It acted as a communication layer between the JavaScript thread and the Native thread. It used asynchronous message passing for communication, which often led to delays or performance bottlenecks, especially for complex interactions.
4. **UI Thread**: The UI thread was responsible for rendering the actual UI on the screen. It was separate from the JavaScript and Native threads but would occasionally interact with them.

#### Limitations of the Old Architecture:
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: The Bridge caused performance issues due to the overhead of passing messages between the JavaScript and Native threads, especially in cases where large amounts of data or frequent updates were needed.
- **Complex Debugging**: The multiple threads involved made debugging and tracking performance issues more complicated.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Adding new features like Hermes, a JavaScript engine, or integrating with native modules in a more flexible manner was more challenging.
- **Latency in Updates**: The communication over the Bridge often introduced latency in UI rendering and made the experience less smooth.
- **Native Code Integration**: Integrating with native libraries and components often involved complex, error-prone linking and configurations.

### New React Native Architecture (Fabric and TurboModules)

The new architecture (released in stages around 2021, with full integration expected in 2024) introduces two main components: **Fabric** and **TurboModules**. These new innovations were designed to address the limitations of the old architecture.

#### Key Components of the New Architecture:
1. **Fabric**:
   - **New UI Layer**: Fabric is a re-engineered UI rendering system for React Native. It replaces the old "bridge" architecture that connected JavaScript with native components. Instead of using a separate bridge, Fabric allows direct communication between JavaScript and native components in a more efficient way.
   - **Synchronous Updates**: Fabric enables synchronous communication between the JavaScript thread and the native UI, making UI updates much faster and smoother.
   - **UI Managers and Shadow Tree**: The Shadow Tree is a lightweight representation of the native UI that can be manipulated by JavaScript. It allows for better performance by reducing unnecessary work on the native side.
   
2. **TurboModules**:
   - **Faster Native Module Communication**: TurboModules replace the old native module system, providing a faster and more efficient way to call native code from JavaScript. It removes the overhead of serialization and deserialization of data that happened with the Bridge in the old architecture.
   - **Lazy Loading of Native Modules**: TurboModules enable lazy loading, meaning native modules are loaded only when they are needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving startup time.
   - **Direct Calls to Native Code**: TurboModules introduce a more direct and efficient way to invoke native code, eliminating the need for a bridge and the associated performance bottlenecks.

3. **JSI (JavaScript Interface)**:
   - **JSI provides a more direct connection between JavaScript and native code**. JSI allows JavaScript to interact with native modules without the need for the Bridge. This reduces latency and allows for synchronous communication between the JavaScript and native layers.

4. **Hermes (optional JavaScript Engine)**:
   - **Hermes is an optimized JavaScript engine** created specifically for React Native. It improves performance by reducing memory usage and speeding up JavaScript execution, and is now more tightly integrated with the new architecture.

#### Benefits of the New Architecture:
- **Better Performance**: The new architecture reduces the overhead of the Bridge and allows for more efficient communication between JavaScript and native code. This leads to faster UI updates, smoother performance, and a better user experience.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: With Fabric and TurboModules, developers can expect faster iteration times, easier debugging, and better support for native modules.
- **Scalability**: The new architecture is designed to be more flexible and scalable, making it easier to maintain large applications and integrate with new technologies.
- **Improved Native Code Integration**: With TurboModules, React Native has better support for integrating with native code and libraries, simplifying the process of creating custom modules and native components.

### Comparison of Old vs. New Architecture

| **Aspect**               | **Old Architecture**                           | **New Architecture**                           |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Communication**         | Asynchronous message passing through the Bridge. | Synchronous, direct communication (Fabric + TurboModules). |
| **Performance**           | Prone to performance bottlenecks due to the Bridge. | Faster updates and reduced latency with Fabric and TurboModules. |
| **UI Updates**            | UI updates are delayed due to the Bridge.       | Synchronous updates for more responsive UI rendering. |
| **Native Code Integration** | Complex and error-prone integration with native modules. | Streamlined and efficient integration with TurboModules. |
| **Threading Model**       | Separate threads for JavaScript, UI, and Native code. | More efficient threading model with less overhead. |
| **Flexibility**           | Limited flexibility for modern mobile features. | Better support for modern mobile features, easier to extend. |
| **Memory and CPU Efficiency** | Higher memory usage and CPU load due to the Bridge. | Optimized for memory and CPU usage (e.g., with Hermes). |
| **Debugging**             | Difficult to debug due to multiple threads and the Bridge. | Easier to debug with improved tools and direct communication. |

### Conclusion

The new React Native architecture (with Fabric, TurboModules, and JSI) addresses many of the limitations of the old architecture, offering improved performance, better developer experience, and more efficient native code integration. The transition to this new architecture marks a significant step forward for React Native, making it more competitive for building high-performance mobile applications. While the old architecture is still widely used, the new architecture is being gradually rolled out and will eventually replace the old model, especially for large-scale, performance-critical applications.
