### **Top Highlight: Security Aspects to Consider for a React Native Application**  
**By Halak Vachhani**  
*Simform Engineering, Published on June 3, 2021*  

Creating secure mobile apps requires attention to sensitive data handling. React Native applications, like other JavaScript-based frameworks, are prone to vulnerabilities, requiring robust security measures.

#### **Common Security Issues in React Native Applications**  

**1. Storing Sensitive Information:**  
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive keys/secrets in your app code, as these can be easily extracted.  
- Use tools like `react-native-dotenv` and secure device storage (e.g., iOS Keychain, Android Keystore) for sensitive data like API secrets and tokens.  

**2. Local Storage Security:**  
- Avoid storing sensitive data in `AsyncStorage` (unencrypted).  
- Opt for libraries like `react-native-encrypted-storage` or `redux-persist-sensitive-storage` for secure storage.  

**3. Deep Linking Risks:**  
- Custom URI schemes are vulnerable to hijacking by malicious apps.  
- Use **Universal Links** (iOS) or **App Links** (Android) for secure deep linking and prevent sensitive data transfer in links.  

**4. Platform-Specific Concerns:**  
- **Android:** Use ProGuard rules to obfuscate code and reduce reverse engineering risks.  
- **iOS:** Configure `NSAppTransportSecurity` in `Info.plist` to restrict insecure domain access.  

**5. Authentication Security:**  
- Use OAuth-2 with Proof of Key Code Exchange (PKCE) to prevent unauthorized token exchanges.  
- Libraries like `react-native-app-auth` provide secure OAuth-2 support.  

**6. SSL Encryption & SSL Pinning:**  
- Protect data with SSL encryption.  
- Implement **SSL Pinning** to validate server certificates during client-server communication.

#### **JavaScript Vulnerabilities in React Native**  
React Native inherits common JavaScript vulnerabilities like code injection. Addressing these issues requires keeping dependencies up-to-date and using secure coding practices.

#### **Building a Secure React Native App**  
1. **Platform Expertise:** Ensure platform-specific security measures for iOS and Android.  
2. **Manage Dependencies:** Regularly update and audit third-party libraries for security vulnerabilities.  
3. **Secure Framework-Specific Features:** Address React Native-specific risks, such as local storage and deep linking.

By implementing these security measures, you can ensure that your React Native applications are not just functional but also resilient against potential threats.
